## Introduction

Navigating the news ecosystem we live in now is a daunting task. Reading content from only one source 
can leave you missing a critical piece of information or important perspective. We need to be able to see the whole 
picture to inform our opinions. In a time when trust in institutions like media companies is low, we can use aggregation to find 
the through-lines in content. This connective tissue should represent the most agreed-upon information, and therefore, 
hopefully, the truth. Conscious information consumers are busy, and need tools to help them accomplish this task.

## Overview

Consensus helps as do just that by drawing in information from varied sources, distilling the 
critical information from each, synthesizing that information, and offering a comprehensive view of topics.

## Features
How does it work?

### Data Source Selection

When exploring a topic, rely on pre-configured source combinations, or create your own. Tailor your coverage to your 
needs.

### Synthesizer Selection

Consensus uses language models like chatgpt to synthesize large amounts of data from your selected sources. It 
also gives you the power to select the model that you wish to use, giving you more control over the content you consume.

### Reliability and Bias Scoring

It's important to be aware of bias in content, the reliability of sources, and the impact that LLMs have on the content 
you are reading. Consensus offers you high level scores to help you be aware of these metrics when combining sources 
and LLMs, as well as more detailed breakdowns, so you can be sure you are seeing the highest quality content available.
